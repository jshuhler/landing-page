# HTML and CSS Personal Landing Page
I'm creating a personal landing page using HTML and CSS with the skills I've been learning with [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). 

It's definitely going to be a little rough around the edges, but hopefully it will look something like this when it's done!
